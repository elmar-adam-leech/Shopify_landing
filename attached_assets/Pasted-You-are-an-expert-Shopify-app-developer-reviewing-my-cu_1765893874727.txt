You are an expert Shopify app developer reviewing my custom drag-and-drop page builder app (similar to Replo/Shogun but focused on ad-optimized dynamic landing pages).

I have already built the core of the app in this Repl. Please thoroughly analyze the current codebase and compare it to the full required feature set below.

For each feature, tell me:
- ✅ Fully implemented (and briefly describe how it's done)
- 🟡 Partially implemented (what's there and what's missing)
- ❌ Not implemented yet (suggest next steps or code structure)

Required Features:

1. **Shopify App Setup**
   - Proper OAuth authentication and session handling
   - Embedded app in Shopify admin using App Bridge
   - Working ngrok/preview URL for testing in dev stores

2. **Drag-and-Drop Editor**
   - Polaris UI for native Shopify look
   - Sidebar with draggable blocks (Hero Banner, Product Grid, Text Block, Image Block, Form Block, Phone Number Block, Chat Block)
   - Canvas with dnd-kit for dropping, reordering, and configuring blocks
   - Block settings panel (e.g., edit text, select products/collections)

3. **Dynamic Shopify Data**
   - Real-time fetching of products, collections, variants, metafields via Admin API (preferably GraphQL)
   - Dynamic rendering in blocks (e.g., Product Grid shows live prices/images)

4. **Query String & Traffic Source Personalization (CRITICAL)**
   - Ability to set conditions per block or globally (e.g., if utm_source=meta, if offer=50off, if referrer contains facebook.com)
   - Support for multiple conditions with fallbacks
   - Preview mode to test different query strings
   - Generated client-side JavaScript in published pages that reads URL params and referrer and dynamically shows/hides/swaps content

5. **Ad Pixels & Events Integration**
   - Dedicated settings tab/section for configuring major platforms (Meta Pixel, Google Ads/Tag Manager, TikTok, Pinterest)
   - Input fields for pixel IDs and custom scripts
   - Automatic injection of <head>/<body> scripts in published pages
   - Standard event firing (PageView, AddToCart, InitiateCheckout, Purchase)
   - Custom event firing on form submit (e.g., Lead)

6. **Trackable Forms**
   - Form Block with customizable fields
   - Server-side submission endpoint (creates customer, draft order, or webhook)
   - Fires ad pixel conversion events on submit
   - Preserves UTMs/GCLIDs

7. **Phone Number Block**
   - Display dynamic or static trackable phone numbers
   - Optional placeholders or hooks for call tracking

8. **Shopify Inbox Integration**
   - Chat Block that embeds the official Shopify Inbox widget
   - Optional conditional display based on traffic source/query params

9. **Publishing Flow**
   - Save button serializes page state (blocks + conditions + pixel configs) to HTML + Liquid + JS
   - Backend endpoint uses Shopify Admin API to create/update pages (/pages) or theme assets
   - Preserves query strings in published URLs
   - Draft storage (Replit DB or SQLite)

10. **General**
    - Clean, modular code structure
    - Error handling and loading states
    - Mobile-responsive preview

After reviewing the current code, give me:
- A clear summary table or list of the status of each feature above
- Prioritized next steps (top 3–5 gaps to close first)
- Specific files or components I should focus on adding/modifying

Focus especially on whether the query string personalization and ad pixel systems are functional or started—these are the most important for my advertising goals.
